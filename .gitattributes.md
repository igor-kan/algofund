# Git Attributes Configuration for algofund

This file configures how Git handles files in this repository.

## Purpose

The `.gitattributes` file ensures:
1. **Consistent line endings** across all platforms
2. **Proper binary file detection** to prevent corruption
3. **Accurate language statistics** on GitHub
4. **Clean diffs** by excluding generated files
5. **Cross-platform compatibility** for all contributors

## Key Features

### Line Ending Normalization
- **Text files**: Automatically normalized to LF (Unix-style)
- **Windows scripts**: Maintained as CRLF where appropriate
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior regardless of developer OS

### Binary File Detection
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, GIF, ICO properly marked as binary
- **Fonts**: TTF, WOFF, WOFF2 handled correctly
- **Archives**: ZIP, 7Z, GZ preserved without modification
- **Media**: MP4, MP3, MOV protected from text processing

### Language Statistics
- **Generated files**: Excluded from GitHub language detection
- **Vendor code**: node_modules, bower_components marked as vendored
- **Build artifacts**: dist/, build/, .next/ excluded from stats
- **Documentation**: README, LICENSE marked appropriately

### Project-Specific Rules
- **Node.js**: Package lock files excluded from diffs
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Proper syntax highlighting
- **Next.js**: Build output and generated files handled

### Diff and Merge Settings
- **JSON files**: Enhanced diff formatting
- **Markdown files**: Improved diff display
- **Lock files**: Excluded from diff and merge operations
- **Generated files**: Hidden from code review diffs

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Development**: Same line endings for all developers
2. **Clean Repository**: No accidental binary file corruption
3. **Accurate Metrics**: Correct language statistics on GitHub
4. **Better Code Review**: Focus on actual code changes, not formatting
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works identically on Windows, macOS, Linux

## Maintenance

This file is automatically managed and should not require manual editing.
If you need to modify file handling rules, consider:

1. Testing changes locally first
2. Understanding the impact on existing files
3. Coordinating with other contributors
4. Documenting any custom rules added
